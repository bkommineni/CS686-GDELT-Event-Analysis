# Dataset 
## GDELT(The Global Database of Events, Language and Tone)
## Goal of the Project: Visualize, explore, and export the GDELT Event Database.
By quantitatively codifying human societyâ€™s events, dreams and fears,  we are planning to map happiness and conflict, provide insight to vulnerable populations, and even potentially forecast global conflict in ways that allow us as a society to come together to deescalate tensions, counter extremism.

**Instructor Comment**: This sounds pretty amazing, but is there something a bit more concrete you'll be doing? :-) Also, since you requested to have your group name changed, let me know what you'd like it changed to (although I think it's awesome as-is!!).

# Collecting and cleaning the data

To speed up the download process we grabbed ZIP files from the GDELT website.
There is one for every day of the years 2015 and 2016 which we are interested in.
ZIP archives, however, are not supported natively by Spark.
So to load those files but still save space on our hard drives we unzipped them and gzipped them instead, because GZIP is supported natively by Spark.

No preprocessing was otherwise necessary as the GDELT dataset is pretty clean.

The GDELT website also provides the header of the CSV file (i.e. the name of the columns separated by tab characters). We converted that to newline-separated values (though not really necessary), and suffixed every column but character-type column with a color and the type it should be parsed at, e.g. IntegerType.
We then created a StructType with StructFields.

Here is the code:

```python
from pyspark.sql.types import StructType, StructField, StringType, FloatType, LongType, IntegerType, BooleanType

types = {
    'Float': lambda: FloatType(),
    'Integer': lambda: LongType(), # the spec does not distinguish between integer and long, so long it is
    'Long': lambda: LongType(),
    'Bool': lambda: IntegerType() # like in the NAM dataset, booleans are expressed as numbers (0 and 1)
}

feats = []
with open('CSV.header.txt') as header_file:
    for lineno, line in enumerate(header_file):
        line = line.strip()
        if ':' in line:
            feat_name, type_name = line.split(':')
            feats.append(StructField(feat_name, types[type_name](), True))
        else:
            feats.append(StructField(line, StringType(), True))
            
schema = StructType(feats)
```

# Info about features

The [GDELT file format](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/GDELT-Data_Format_Codebook.pdf) (it's really a tab-separated text file) contains records related to events around the world. It uses the [CAMEO](http://data.gdeltproject.org/documentation/CAMEO.Manual.1.1b3.pdf) taxonomy to classify the organisms (government and non-government), actors (such as persons, multinational companies, governments), and actions (warn, appeal, decline to comment, accuse, protest, impose,  etc.)

Each event can be qualified using the following groups of attributes:

  - Event 
    * Date: actually the date of publication in the media, but 97 % of the news relate to the current day
    * Location: where an event took place, even when it involves two actors associated with other countries, e.g. an American citizen appealing against a British citizen in the court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, France.
    * Type, code, etc.: event classification
    * Statistics: # of mentions, # of sources, average tone \[positive or negative\], impact of the news on the stability of the country, 
  - Actor 1: the main party or one of the two main parties involved
  - Actor 2: the second party involved. In some cases, there is no second actor.
  - Source URL: Link to the article a record is extracted from
 
Most attribute contain character information such as country codes and actor type codes.
A few are related to dates (year, month-year, SQL date...)
And then there are the numeric ones:

  - Event location geocoordinates
  - AvgTone, as explained above, which is defined between -100 for an extremely negative event to +100 for an extremely positive event. A small riot will have a slightly low average tone, where as the end of a war would get an extremely positive tone.
  - Number of articles, sources, and mentions: one or more
  - Goldstein Scale: expresses whether the event will have a good impact (+10) or a bad impact (-10) to the country in question, with every value inbetween.
  - QuadClass: which of the 4 main classification groups applies (Verbal/Material Cooperation/Conflict)

# Analysis

We played the role of the professor a little bit and imagined a couple of questions:

## What are the most discussed topics implicating both the United States and Switzerland?
