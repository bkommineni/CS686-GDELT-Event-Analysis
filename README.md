https://www.cs.usfca.edu/~mmalensek/courses/cs686/projects/project-3.html

# Collaboration plan
## Team Members:
Mathieu Clement,
Anjani Bajaj,
Bhargavi Kommineni,
Surada Lerkpatomsak,

# Dataset 
## GDELT(The Global Database of Events, Language and Tone)
## Goal of the Project: Visualize, explore, and export the GDELT Event Database.
By quantitatively codifying human societyâ€™s events, dreams and fears,  we are planning to map happiness and conflict, provide insight to vulnerable populations, and even potentially forecast global conflict in ways that allow us as a society to come together to deescalate tensions, counter extremism.

**Instructor Comment**: This sounds pretty amazing, but is there something a bit more concrete you'll be doing? :-) Also, since you requested to have your group name changed, let me know what you'd like it changed to (although I think it's awesome as-is!!).
